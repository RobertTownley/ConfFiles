# ConfFiles
A place to store my conf files. Feedback/stealing encouraged!

# How To Use This
To provision (set up) your computer the way I like mine set up, you can download this git repo, give the `provision.sh`
script executable permissions, and run it locally.

Or, if you trust me a lot, you can run the following command:
`sudo apt install curl && source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertTownley/dot_files/master/provision.sh)`
